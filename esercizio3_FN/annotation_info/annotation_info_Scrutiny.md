# **FRAME: Scrutiny**

> This frame concerns a Cognizer (a person or other intelligent being) paying close attention to something, the Ground, in order to discover and note its salient characteristics.  The Cognizer may be interested in a particular characteristic or entity, the Phenomenon, that belongs to the Ground or is contained in the Ground (or to ensure that such a property of entity is not present).  Some words in this frame allow alternate expressions of the Groundand the Phenomenon: 'We searched the yard  for my contact lens.'
