# **FRAME: Remainder**

> A Resource is depleted by some process, resulting in there being only a Remainder in existence some time into or after the process. The original Resource may be indicated metonymically via reference to an Original_owner. The Location where the Resource is found may be expressed.  'There are only two poems left from Quayle' 'After the storm, only two houses were left DNI' 'Not much was left in the till' 'Nothing remained for the youngest brother from the inheritance' 'Only this school is left from the 1970s; all the other ones are newer.'
